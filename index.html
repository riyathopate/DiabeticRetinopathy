                <p class="data">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye condition that affects individuals with diabetes, 
                    potentially leading to vision loss if left untreated. Understanding the importance of early 
                    detection and proactive eye care is essential for preserving vision and maintaining overall 
                    health.
                    <br>
                    Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in your sretina, 
                    the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. This damage can lead to:

                    Diabetes can affect more than just your blood sugar.
                    <br>
                    Diabetic retinopathy, or DR, is a complication that can damage the retina, the light sensitive layer at the back of your eye. Over time, uncontrolled blood sugar can weaken 
                    the blood vessels in your retina, leading to leakage, bleeding, and even abnormal new 
                    blood vessel growth.

                    <br>
                    • Maintaining good blood sugar control is the cornerstone of preventing DR. This 
                    means working closely with your healthcare team to manage your diabetes 
                    effectively.
                    <br>
                    • A key tool is the HbA1c test, which measures your average blood sugar control over 
                    the past 2-3 months. Your doctor will recommend a target HbA1c level based on your 
                    individual health factors.

                <p class="data">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye condition that affects individuals with diabetes, 
                    potentially leading to vision loss if left untreated. Understanding the importance of early 
                    detection and proactive eye care is essential for preserving vision and maintaining overall 
                    health.
                    <br>
                    Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in your sretina, 
                    the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. This damage can lead to:

                    <br>
                    Diabetes can affect more than just your blood sugar.
                    <br>
                    Diabetic retinopathy, or DR, is a complication that can damage the retina, the light sensitive layer at the back of your eye. Over time, uncontrolled blood sugar can weaken 
                    the blood vessels in your retina, leading to leakage, bleeding, and even abnormal new 
                    blood vessel growth.

                    <br>
                    • Maintaining good blood sugar control is the cornerstone of preventing DR. This 
                    means working closely with your healthcare team to manage your diabetes 
                    effectively.
                    <br>
                    • A key tool is the HbA1c test, which measures your average blood sugar control over 
                    the past 2-3 months. Your doctor will recommend a target HbA1c level based on your 
                    individual health factors.
